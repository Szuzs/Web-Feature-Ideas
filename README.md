# Web-Feature-Ideas
 
This tool allows you to access web-based features that are broadly supported by most browsers, offering at least 95% coverage.

## How to use
Choose the number of web features you need. Optionally, you can filter by categories by selecting or deselecting the category checkboxes. By default, the tool suggests 5 feature ideas across all categories.

The retrieved data is displayed in card format. Each card includes the name of the web feature, which links to the 'Can I Use' webpage in a new tab. Additionally, it shows the overall browser support percentage and relevant category tags.
